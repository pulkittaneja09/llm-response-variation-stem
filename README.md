# Prompt Sensitivity and Response Variation in Large Language Models for STEM Education

This repository contains the dataset, analysis code, and figures used in the research project:

**“Prompt Sensitivity and Response Variation in Large Language Models for STEM Education.”**

The study investigates how different prompt phrasing styles influence the **complexity**, **sentiment**, and **behavioral stability** of two widely used large language models — **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** — when answering STEM-based questions.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **240 prompt–response pairs**, generated by combining:
- **30 STEM questions**
- **4 prompt phrasing types**  
  - Neutral  
  - Leading  
  - Contradictory  
  - Self-Doubt  
- **2 LLMs** (ChatGPT, Gemini)

Each response is annotated with:
- **ACCURACY** (Correct / Incorrect)  
- **COMPLEXITY** (1–5 scale)  
- **SENTIMENT** (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

### File:

| QUESTION      | Original STEM question |
| PROMPT TYPE   | Neutral / Leading / Contradictory / Self-Doubt |
| MODEL         | ChatGPT or Gemini |
| RESPONSE      | Model-generated answer |
| ACCURACY      | Correct or Incorrect |
